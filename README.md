# AES-Encryption-and-Decryption

This is a simple example of how to use the AES encryption algorithm in C# to encrypt and decrypt a key. The program generates a random key, encrypts it using AES, and then decrypts it to compare with the original key. The encryption key and vector are hard-coded for simplicity, but can be easily modified to suit specific needs.
